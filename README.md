# Simple Map block

Allow you to add a simple map in your content. You can add one marker with a popup and you have a few option to style everything.

All the map blocks use [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).


You will need a Mapbox account and API key. Define the key in your `wp-config.php` like so:

```php
define( 'MAPBOX_KEY', 'KEY' );
```
